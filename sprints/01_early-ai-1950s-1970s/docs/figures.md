# Early AI Pioneers

## Alan Turing

- Contribution: Proposed the concept of a universal computing machine and introduced the imitation game (Turing Test).
- Summary: In "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), Turing explored whether machines could think, formulating the Turing Test as a practical criterion. His work laid the theoretical foundations for computer science and AI.

## Newell & Simon

- Contribution: Developed the Logic Theorist, the first program to automate theorem proving, and pioneered symbolic AI and the General Problem Solver.
- Summary: Their work demonstrated that human problem-solving could be modeled via symbolic logic and heuristics, influencing AI research on automated reasoning and cognitive simulation.

## Frank Rosenblatt

- Contribution: Invented the perceptron, an early neural network model for pattern recognition.
- Summary: Rosenblatt's perceptron demonstrated that machines could learn via weight adjustments. His 1958 work sparked both excitement and controversy, paving the way for future neural network research.
