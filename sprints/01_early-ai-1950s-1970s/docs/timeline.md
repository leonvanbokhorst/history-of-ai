# Timeline of Early AI (1950sâ€“1970s)

## Turing Test (1950)

- Description: A proposal by Alan Turing to evaluate a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.
- Key Notes: Introduced the imitation game concept; set the stage for AI evaluation criteria.
- References: Turing, A.M. (1950). _Computing Machinery and Intelligence_.

## Logic Theorist (1956)

- Description: The first AI program by Newell & Simon that proved mathematical theorems, emulating human problem-solving.
- Key Notes: Demonstrated symbolic reasoning on the JOHNNIAC computer.
- References: Newell, J.C., Shaw, J.C., & Simon, H.A. (1957). _The Logic Theory Machine_.

## Perceptron (1958)

- Description: Frank Rosenblatt's single-layer neural network model simulating neuron learning, capable of simple pattern classification.
- Key Notes: Generated early excitement and later criticism for its inability to solve non-linearly separable tasks like XOR; foundational for modern neural nets.
- References: Rosenblatt, F. (1958). _The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in The Brain_.

## Shakey the Robot (1966)

- Description: The first mobile robot that could perceive its environment and plan actions using STRIPS planning.
- Key Notes: Developed at SRI International; combined perception, planning, and execution in a single system.
- References: Nilsson, N.J. (1969). _Shakey the Robot_.
