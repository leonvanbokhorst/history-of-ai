# Sprint 1: Early AI (1950s–1970s)

## Sprint Goal

Explore the key breakthroughs and foundations of AI from 1950 to 1970.

## Tasks / Learning Objectives

1. [x] Research and document key early AI milestones (Turing Test, Logic Theorist, Perceptron, Shakey the Robot) and capture them in `docs/timeline.md`.
2. [x] Implement a Python demo of the Perceptron algorithm on a simple dataset in `code/perceptron_demo.py`.
3. [x] Summarize contributions of early AI pioneers (Alan Turing, Newell & Simon, Frank Rosenblatt) in `docs/figures.md`.
4. [x] Scaffold Turing Test & Logic Theorist demos in `code/`.
5. [x] Create combined explainer in `docs/explainer.md`.

## Definition of Done / Key Questions Answered

- [x] `docs/timeline.md` lists at least four major early AI milestones with dates and descriptions.
- [x] `code/perceptron_demo.py` runs end-to-end, training and evaluating a simple perceptron model.
- [x] `docs/figures.md` contains detailed summaries of each pioneer's work and links to original resources.
- [x] Turing Test and Logic Theorist demos run successfully.
- [x] Sprint README updated with guide for novice AI-engineers.

## Guide for Novice AI-Engineers

Welcome aboard this time-traveling journey through the origins of AI! Follow these steps to make the most of Sprint 1:

1. Explore the Story
   - Read [Timeline of Milestones](docs/timeline.md) to meet the milestones: Turing Test, Logic Theorist, Perceptron, and Shakey the Robot.
2. Meet the Pioneers
   - Check out [Pioneer Profiles](docs/figures.md) for Turing, Newell & Simon, Rosenblatt, and more.
3. Get Your Hands Dirty
   - [`turing_test_demo.py`](code/turing_test_demo.py) – Play a simple Turing Test mimicking bot (run `python code/turing_test_demo.py`).
   - [`logic_theorist_demo.py`](code/logic_theorist_demo.py) – Watch symbolic logic prove a theorem with Sympy (run `python code/logic_theorist_demo.py`).
   - [`perceptron_demo.py`](code/perceptron_demo.py) – Train and test your perceptron on an OR-gate (run `python code/perceptron_demo.py`).
   - [`shakey_planning_demo.py`](code/shakey_planning_demo.py) – Peek at the planning stub; your turn to implement the pathfinder (run `python code/shakey_planning_demo.py`).
4. Deep Dive with Explanations
   - Open [Explainer Document](docs/explainer.md) for side-by-side code snippets and narrative context.

Feel free to tweak prompts, add new milestones or demos, and share your discoveries. Happy hacking—and may your code be as elegant as Turing's theories!
