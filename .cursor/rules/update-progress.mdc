# Update progress
1. Update the sprint tasklist in the README.md file in the directory of the current sprint if applicable.
2. Update all links and descriptions to the notes and results of this sprint clickable in the same README of the sprint.
3. Update @progress.md based on the current progress of the user if applicable.
3. Finally update the backlog to be current and tidy. Do we need to change direction? Are we on track to get to our epic?
